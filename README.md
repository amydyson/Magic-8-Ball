# Magic-8-Ball

This is an introduction to JavaScript exercise.  It lets a user type in a question to the Magic 8 Ball, which then randomly selects an answer.

When the user presses the "answer" button, it triggers the JavaScript function answer() using on-click, and answer then runs the random generator code and writes the answer on the page.
